Introduction (pre-project):

This is the first project in The Odin Project - Foundation series.
This is an HTML only project. Once completed I will demonstrate
basic use of HTML and its functionality, including stylized elements
such as titles, headings, bolding, italicization, and lists. I will
also demonstrate the knowledge of a basic HTML boilerplate, links
(relative and absolute), images, and pushing code to GitHub using
Git on the command line with proper commit messages.


Conclusion (post-project):
