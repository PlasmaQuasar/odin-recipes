        <p>Great recipe for a double cheeseburger. Made similar to</p>

        <p>raw onions (fries and drink not included).</p>
        <p>People that didn't grow up in California just won't get it ;)</p>

            <li>1/3 lb Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1 Pinch Salt</li>
            <li>2 Cheddar or American Cheese Singles</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Thousand Island Dressing</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>
